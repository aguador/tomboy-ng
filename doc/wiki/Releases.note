<bold>Installation</bold></size:huge>

tomboy-ng is available for Linux, Mac and Windows. Please see your operating system below -<size:large>

<bold>Windows</bold></size:large>
Tested on 32bit Windows Vista and 64bit Windows 10.  Windows users should download the Windows Installer, $$EXE, it works for both 32 and 64bit installs.  Windows Defender will (quite rightly) tell you it stopped an unrecognised app, warning its risky. Click "More Info" and you will see a "Run Anyway". Now you will be asked if you want to allow an unknown publisher (me!) to change your device. If you do, click yes. Depending on your build of Win10, you may need to go through a process of clicking the More Info link and Run Anyway, possibly through several stages. <size:large>

<bold>MacOSX</bold></size:large>
Tested on a Mac Sierra Powerbook. Use [the 64bit (Cocoa) DMG file]($$DMG64).Install by double clicking the .dmg file and drag the tomboy-ng icon into the nearby Applications Folder. Because I don't pay a fee to Apple, first time users will need to control click (that is, hold the Control Key down and click) the tomboy-ng icon in Applications and select "Open". 

I am only shipping the 64bit Cocoa version now.<size:huge>

<bold>Linux</bold></size:huge>
Linux users need to be a bit careful about which version they download. With quite a range of Distributions,  Desktops, 32bit and 64bit and GTK2 v. Qt5 to cater for, its not easy ! The Qt5 version requires Qt5.12 or later and 64bit. The GTK version, GTK2. Here is some advice but you may well have a good reason to do otherwise with, for example, the GTK2 and Qt5 decision. Due to some inconsistencies in Desktops, sometimes tomboy-ng does not detect if you are using a dark theme, if so affected, consider switching from GTK2 to Qt5 or visa versa.<size:large>

<bold>PPA using distros, Ubuntu, Linux Mint etc</bold></size:large>
New in v0.30, Ubuntu and derivative users (of 64bit U18.04 and U20.04) can use a PPA to install this and subsquent releases of tomboy-ng.  Please see https://launchpad.net/~d-bannon/+archive/ubuntu/ppa-tomboy-ng for details but the process is -
<list><list-item dir="ltr">sudo add-apt-repository ppa:d-bannon/ppa-tomboy-ng [enter]</list-item></list>
<list><list-item dir="ltr">sudo apt-get update  [enter]</list-item></list>
<list><list-item dir="ltr">sudo apt install tomboy-ng  [enter]</list-item></list>
After that, your OS will update tomboy-ng on each release without you doing anything.

For distributions that use .deb packages (but cannot use the PPA), do yourself a favour, install Gdebi before you start. You will not regret it.<size:large>

<bold>Ubuntu</bold></size:large>
  
Firstly, consider using the PPA (above). Otherwise, generally, all versions work fine but earlier distributions should use GTK2 and recent ones may use Qt5 based version. 
<list><list-item dir="ltr">16.04 Use GTK2 version[32bit]($$DEB32) or [64bit]($$DEB64). Will not work with QT5.</list-item></list>
<list><list-item dir="ltr">18.04 Ubuntu Mate, 18.04 Gnome - please use the GTK2 version [32bit]($$DEB32) or [64bit]($$DEB64).  Difficult to make work with Qt5.</list-item></list>
<list><list-item dir="ltr">20.04 Your choice between  [64bit QT]($$DEB64QT)  which needs the Qt5 libaries or the [64bit]($$DEB64) which needs only a couple of exta things. </list-item></list>

On Ubuntu, you can install the appropriate package in one of several way (and I am sorry this keeps changing) -

<list><list-item dir="ltr"><bold>Recommended, install gdebi first</bold>.  Its available from your normal repos and is easy and reliable. Then download the approprate tomboy-ng package, your browser will direct it to Gdebi. Strongly recommeded for U16.04.</list-item></list>
<list><list-item dir="ltr">Depending on your version, you may be able to download and get directed to another tool to install, perhaps Software Installer. Good luck. </list-item></list>
<list><list-item dir="ltr">Thirdly, will work on all except U16.04, click on the appropriate link, download and save the file. Use  the following apt command (note the './' in front of the filename, you must be in the directory where the downloaded file is and explicitly state the location of the file, else apt will look in its own repositories). Adjust the deb name for your specific downloaded file -</list-item></list>

<monospace>sudo apt install ./tomboy-ng_0.29-0_amd64.deb [enter]</monospace><size:large>

<bold>Linux Mint</bold></size:large>
Firstly, consider using the PPA (above).  Otherwise note I have only tested against 19.2 Cinnamon. This, and 19.3 Cinnamon are based on Ubuntu 18.04, so use the GTK versions only,  [32bit]($$DEB32) or [64bit]($$DEB64) .  
Click on the appropriate link from your browser and allow the suggested installer, GDebi, to run the install for you. Linux Mint does report any install errors that happen during this process (unlike some distros!) so its a good approach. <size:large>


<bold>Fedora</bold></size:large>

Tested on Fedora 33. Generally,  on Fedora the [GTK2 32bit]($$RPM32) or [GTK2 64bit]($$RPM64) version is recommended. To install, please click on appropriate link, download and save, then use the yum command, eg -

<monospace>sudo yum localinstall ./tomboy-ng-0.31-2.x86_64.rpm [enter]   </monospace>

note the Qt5 version has a slightly different file name

<bold>Fedora's default install is based on Gnome</bold> and  recent Gnome versions block the System Tray icon. You have two choices, either install the tint2 dock panel (my recommendation, <italic><bold>sudo yum install tint2</bold></italic> &lt;enter&gt;) or you need to use tomboy-ng in a  slightly different way. After starting tomboy-ng (the first time), click "Activities", top left and look for the yellow tomboy-ng icon on your dock. Right click it and choose <bold>add to favourites</bold>. You can now 'Hide' the tomboy-ng splash screen and activate tomboy-ng at any time directly from the dock.  To really close tomboy-ng, click the tomboy-ng icon in the dock, tomboy-ng's search box opens, click 'Menu' and 'close'.  Many users hide the small splash screen at tomboy-ng start, if you set it like this, Fedora Gnome will appear to do nothing as you start it (because you cannot see the System Tray Icon) so, perhaps, its a good idea to setup tomboy-ng to show the Search Screen at startup.

I suggest approaches based around Gnome extensions and libappindicator3 are really just too hard. 

Other flavours of Fedora (eg <bold> Plasma, Cinnamon, XFce</bold>) all seem happy to display the System Tray Icon.

Fedora seems to now try and run Qt5 apps under Xorg even when Wayland is the default display manager (that's nice), however my tests indicate it does generate some apparently harmless warnings. So try the  [Qt5 64bit]($$RPM64QT) version if you like, it will be a smaller dependencies download on a new install.<size:large>

<bold>Debian</bold></size:large>
Its just possible that by time you read this, tomboy-ng (Qt5, v0.31) will be in the Debian unstable/testing repository. So, try apt install tomboy-ng.

For earlier versions and distros based on them, (e.g, MX Linux 18.x), you will need to use the [32bit]($$DEB32) or [64bit]($$DEB64) GTK2 version. Stretch does not have the Qt5 Pascal libraries in its repository.  By time you get to Debian 10.4, Qt is, perhaps, a better bet if you are using 64bit. [64bit QT]($$DEB64QT).  If you wish to sync to a SMB: network share, you probably will need to install gvfs and gvfs-fuse. Tell tomboy-ng that the share (when open) is in something like /run/user/1000/gvfs/smb-share\:server\=greybox\,share\=store2 (where greybox is the server and store2 the share).

<bold>Debian XFCe</bold> - the default desktop for Debian.  Works fine with either GTK2 or Qt but the GTK2 version issues some irrelevent messages so use the  [64bit QT]($$DEB64QT) if you can.

<bold>Debian Gnome</bold> - Recent Gnome versions block the System Tray icon, please see the Fedora Gnome section above for how to deal with this problem. The [GTK2 32bit]($$DEB32) or [GTK2 64bit]($$DEB64) will work fine otherwise.

<bold>Debian Plasma</bold> - works fine. Being Qt based, the  [Qt5 64bit]($$DEB64QT) makes sense.

I recommend downloading the file and using the apt command (note the './' in front of the filename, you must explicitly state the location of the file, else apt will look in its own repositories). 

<monospace>sudo apt install ./tomboy-ng_0.31-0_amd64.deb [enter]    -- note Qt5 version has a slightly different name.</monospace><size:large>

<bold>Devian</bold></size:large><bold>
Devaun XFCe</bold> - Tested against version 3.0.0.  Much like Debian above.
 <size:large>
<bold>OpenSuse</bold></size:large>
<list><list-item dir="ltr">It appears there is little difference between the  [GTK2 32bit]($$RPM32) or [GTK2 64bit]($$RPM64) and the [Qt5 64bit]($$RPM64QT) version, if its a new system, maybe the smaller dependencies download for QT is worthwhile.  </list-item></list>

Suse is quite pushy about signing rpm packages, more work for me and it means you need to import the <bold>PGP signature</bold> I have used. So, please download [tomboy-ng-GPG-KEY]($$GPGKEY) (you may need to right click and choose "Save Link as") and run this command in the directory you downloaded to, note this is only necessary once -

<monospace>sudo rpm --import tomboy-ng-GPG-KEY [enter]</monospace>

Next, to install tomboy-ng, please click on appropriate link, and allow the suggested application (Software Install) to handle the install.  If you receive an error message, its almost certainly because you have not yet installed the signature file mentioned above. You may prefer to use the rpm command but remember it does not resolve dependencies, manually installing at least libgtk-2.0 and, perhaps wmctrl may help you there.<size:large>

<bold>Mageia </bold></size:large>
Mageia warns you if you try to install a package who's signature it does not recognise. You can tell it not to worry and install anyway or, to put its mind at rest, download [tomboy-ng-GPGKEY]($$GPGKEY)  (you may need to right click and choose "Save Link as") and run this command in the directory you downloaded to, note this is only necessary once -

<monospace>sudo rpm --import tomboy-ng-GPG-KEY [enter]</monospace>

Then, you can just click on the appropriate tomboy rpm link  [GTK2 32bit]($$RPM32) or [GTK2 64bit]($$RPM64) and allow Software Installer to install it for you but I found it occasionally generated an error that you don't get to see ! Try it by all means but if you don't find your tomboy-ng installed or upgraded, then revert to old fashioned way, download the file, save it, and use a command a bit like this -

<monospace>sudo -c "yum localinstall ./tomboy-ng-0.27-2.x86_64.rpm" [enter]</monospace>

<list><list-item dir="ltr"><bold>Mate, XFCE, KDE (ie Plasma)</bold> <bold>and Cinnamon</bold> work fine. </list-item></list>
<list><list-item dir="ltr"><bold>Mageia with Enlightenment</bold> requires you to activate the System Tray, Settings-&gt;Modules and then scroll down until you find "System Tray" and enable it. Now, you need to assign the System Tray to a Shelf, open the appropriate Shelf, click Add, find the System Tray and choose it. Sadly, Enlightenment in the GTK variety still has a problem, instead of tomboy-ng's icon, you see a white triangular warning icon. But it works.</list-item></list>
<list><list-item dir="ltr"><bold>Mageia Gnome,</bold> some recent Gnome versions block the System Tray icon so you need to use tomboy-ng in a  slightly different way. After starting tomboy-ng (the first time), click "Activities", top left and look for the yellow tomboy-ng icon on your dock. Right click it and choose add to favourites. You can now 'Hide' the tomboy-ng splash screen and activate tomboy-ng at any time directly from the dock.  To really close tomboy-ng, click the tomboy-ng icon in the dock, tomboy-ng's search box opens, click 'Menu' and 'close'.  If you prefer, you can install the Gnome extension TopIcons and libappindicator3 and get a real System Tray Icon. Do not use the Qt5 version as its incompatible with Wayland but the [GTK2 32bit]($$RPM32) or [GTK2 64bit]($$RPM64) will work fine </list-item></list>

To install, please download and save the file, then use the rpm command, note that rpm seems to require you to uninstall a previous version, doing so will not remove notes or config.  Using the <bold>Qt version on Mageia</bold> is possible if you replace its very dated version of lib64qt6pas1 with the appropriate one from https://github.com/davidbannon/libqt5pas/releases. 
 <size:large>
<bold>Raspberry PI</bold></size:large>
This is new in v0.30. Users of the official Raspberry Pi OS (previously know as Raspbian) can now download a deb and install it using the apt commands mentioned above.  Not its 32bit, even if your Raspberry Pi is a 64bit one the OS is 32bit at present. I have not tested against things like Ubuntu's 64bit OS or the testing Raspberry Pi OS.   Download [GTK2 32bit]($$DEB32ARM)
