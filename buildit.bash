# A script to build tomboy-ng from source without using the Lazarus GUI
#
# tomboy-ng depends directly on fpc, lazbuild, lcl and kcontrols.  Because the 
# package based install of fpc/lazarus is quite different to the popular
# installs in user space, we need to allow for both. debuild does not pass the
# user's PATH through so we need to allow for those user space installs.

# * We expect to find FPC (ideally 3.2.0, min 3.0.4) preinstalled. Either on a path
#   indicated by the file ../WHICHFPC or PATH.  Only the ../WHICHFPC method will work
#   if its installed in user space, fpc is not passed through the SRC Deb tool chain. 

# * Lazarus, must find lazbuild, first tries ../WHICHLAZ, then PATH. 
#   If lazbuild is in root space, then lcl is 
#   probably pointed to by /etc/alteratives/lazarus.  If its user space, then
#   we can assume lcl is in the same place as the lazbuild command itself.

# * KControls is bundled into the deb source kit by prepare.bash, its not 
#   present in the github zip file where tomboy-ng calls home. If building
#   from a SRC Deb kit, kcontrols is already in the 'orig' tarball.    

# While really intended to be part of a tool chain to build a Debian Source
# package, its useful as a standalone build tool if all you want is the binary.
# 

# This script runs in the upper tomboy-ng source tree (level with, eg Makefile).

# The files, WHICHFPC and WHICHLAZ are in the directory above, while they can
# created by hand, the script, prepare.bash will also do so if necessary.
# The prepare.bash script will take a github zip file, unpack it, add kcontrols
# and create the necessary ../WHICH* files if it can.  (An optional script, 
# getlaz.bash will build a minimal local lazarus and create its WHICHLAZ.)
